# TensorFlow User Group Rolla

## Who we are

- TFUG Rolla are a group of passionate developers in the field of AI and Deep Learning. We have frequent meetups, workshops and seminars from experts around the world.

## Where are we located

- Rolla is a 2 hour drive from the city of St. Louis, Missouri. We are situated at the Missouri University of Science and Technology campus in Rolla.

## What are we currently working on?

- AI has seen a drastic evolution over the years and right now, we talk about Deep Neural Networks and dig deep into the workings of a Neural Network to familiarize ourselves with the Math before moving on to advanced concepts such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs and finally Transformers and State-Of-The-Art models.
